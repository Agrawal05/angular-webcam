# Ngx-Webcam
A simple Angular 4+ Webcam-Component - pure &amp; minimal, no Flash-Fallback.

If you're looking for a simple to use, minimized version of an Angular webcam-component, this library is just right for you.

**Plug-and-play.** This library contains a single webcam-module which can be imported into nearly every existing Angular 4+ project.

**Simple to use.** One component gives you full control over the your webcam and lets you take screenshots via actions / event bindings.

**Minimal.** No unnecessary Flash-fallbacks, no bundle-size bloating.


## Development
Here you can find instructions on how to start developing this library.

### Build

Run `npm run packagr` to build the library. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Unit Tests
Will follow soon.
